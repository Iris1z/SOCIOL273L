# create a new branch
git checkout -b new_branch
git push -u origin new_branch
when you create a new branch on your local machine, 
Git does not know where to send those tracked changes because that branch is only on your local machine. 
So git push is needed
git push -u origin new_branch

# make changes and merge
in repo's new branch make changes, go to pull request, merge changes
in terminal, pull to get the changes to the local
git pull
